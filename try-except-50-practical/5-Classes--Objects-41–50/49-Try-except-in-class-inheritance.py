# Output:
# Derived error: Action must be implemented.
# The code defines a base class `Base` with an abstract method `action`.
# The derived class `Derived` implements this method and includes a try-except block to handle any exceptions.
# This demonstrates exception handling in class inheritance, ensuring that derived classes can handle errors gracefully.
# The `NotImplementedError` is raised if the method is not overridden, ensuring that derived classes must implement it.
