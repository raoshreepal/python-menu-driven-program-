# 🚀 Python OOP Exception Handling (Programs 41–50)

Welcome to the **advanced Python class & object handling** series, where we mix **OOP** and **Exception Handling** to build clean, safe, and professional-grade code. This set of 10 programs showcases how real-world Python apps deal with errors **inside and around classes**.

---

## 📚 Programs Breakdown (41–50)

### ✅ 41. **Basic Class with Exception Handling**

try:
    print(self.name)
```

🔍 **Goal:** Avoid crashes if a class attribute like `name` is missing.
💡 **Real Use:** Safely displaying user profile info when data may be incomplete (e.g., from a user form or API).

---

### 🚫 42. **Raise Exception from Class Method**

```python
if price < 0:
    raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative.")
```

🔍 **Goal:** Enforce rules directly in the setter method.
💡 **Real Use:** Prevent invalid prices in e-commerce or billing software.

---

### ⚠️ 43. **Custom Exception Class**

```python
class MyError(Exception): pass
```

🔍 **Goal:** Define and raise custom exceptions for specific situations.
💡 **Real Use:** Catch app-specific issues like `InvalidPaymentError`, `BookingConflictError`, etc.

---

### 🏗️ 44. **Try-Except in Constructor**

```python
try:
    # validation in __init__
```

🔍 **Goal:** Handle bad input while creating an object.
💡 **Real Use:** Prevent invalid data at the source—like when users submit a signup form.

---

### 🔎 45. **Handle Missing Attributes**

```python
if hasattr(self, 'model'):
```

🔍 **Goal:** Check if attributes exist before using them.
💡 **Real Use:** In serializers, UI apps, or REST APIs where objects change dynamically.

---

### 🔁 46. **Exception Chaining in Methods**

```python
raise ValueError("Custom msg") from e
```

🔍 **Goal:** Preserve the root cause of an exception.
💡 **Real Use:** Logging tools or error tracking (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) need the full chain of what went wrong.

---

### 💬 47. **Class Method Returning Error Message**

```python
return "Insufficient funds."
```

🔍 **Goal:** Return errors instead of raising them for a smoother UX.
💡 **Real Use:** In mobile/web apps where showing messages is better than crashing the app.

---

### 🧪 48. **Wrap Method Call in Try-Except**

```python
try:
    obj.method()
```

🔍 **Goal:** Keep method logic clean, handle exceptions externally.
💡 **Real Use:** Error handling in service layers of large applications.

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧 49. **Try-Except in Inheritance**

```python
class Base: raise NotImplementedError
```

🔍 **Goal:** Ensure child classes properly override required methods.
💡 **Real Use:** Frameworks like Django, where base classes require custom behavior.

---

### 🧩 50. **Multiple Custom Exceptions**

```python
class AccessError(Exception): pass
class ValidationError(Exception): pass
```

🔍 **Goal:** Throw different exceptions based on the rule being violated.
💡 **Real Use:** Banking, HR, or CRM systems that need to handle permission, input, and logical errors differently.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

These patterns are used in:

* ✅ **Web Development** (Django/Flask APIs)
* 💬 **Chatbots & AI apps** (handling missing data or user errors)
* 🏦 **Fintech apps** (custom errors for fraud, limits, validation)
* 📦 **Data Processing Pipelines** (error logging, retries)
* 🔐 **Enterprise Systems** (RBAC, audit trails, secure failover)
