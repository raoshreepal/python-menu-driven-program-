# 🧬 20 Practical Polymorphism Examples in Python

This repository contains **20 real-world Python programs** that demonstrate the concept of **Polymorphism** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Each example is crafted using relatable domains like banking systems, student management, hospital systems, shopping carts, etc., to help understand and implement polymorphism effectively.

## 📘 What is Polymorphism?

**Polymorphism** allows the same interface (e.g., a method name) to behave differently depending on the object that invokes it.  
In Python, it can be implemented using:

- Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
- Duck Typing
- Function Overloading (Simulated using default parameters or `*args`, `**kwargs`)
