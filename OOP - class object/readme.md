# OOP - Class Object Programs

Welcome to the **OOP - Class Object** folder!
This directory contains practical Python programs demonstrating **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, and encapsulation.

---

## üêç Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful programming paradigm that models real-world entities as **objects** with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). This folder focuses on foundational OOP ideas and their applications in everyday coding tasks.

## üìÇ Programs in this Folder

### 1. **Course-Registration.py**

* Simulates a simple course registration system.
* Demonstrates class creation, adding/removing courses, and displaying enrolled students.
* Shows how objects can manage related data logically.

### 2. **Dictionary-Inside-Class.py**

* Illustrates usage of dictionaries as class attributes.
* Manages data inside a class using dictionary data structure.
* Useful for representing complex, key-value data in objects.

### 3. **Hospital-Patient-Records.py**

* Models a hospital system with patients‚Äô records.
* Adds patient details and retrieves them via class methods.
* Demonstrates data encapsulation and management.

### 4. **Inventory.py**

* Represents an inventory management system.
* Adds, removes, and updates product quantities.
* Shows practical use of classes in handling business logic.

### 5. **Library-System-list.py**

* A basic library management system.
* Uses lists to store book data within classes.
* Demonstrates how to manage collections of objects.

### 6. **List-Inside-Class.py**

* Example showing lists as part of class attributes.
* Manipulates list data inside class instances.
* Great for learning container management in OOP.

### 7. **bamk.py**

* Simulates basic banking operations.
* Implements deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry as class methods.
* Practical example of encapsulating financial data securely.

### 8. **employee.py**

* Manages employee information using classes.
* Demonstrates initialization, updating attributes, and displaying employee data.
* Useful template for HR management systems.

### 9. **library.py**

* Another library management example with slightly different approach.
* Organizes books, borrowers, and lending operations.
* Shows modular design and method interaction.

### 10. **student.py**

* Models student data and academic information.
* Contains methods to update grades and retrieve student profiles.
* Illustrates OOP‚Äôs power in organizing complex data.

## üöÄ Key Concepts Covered

* Class and object creation
* Instance variables and methods
* Using built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries) inside classes
* Encapsulation: controlling access to data
* Real-world system modeling
* Practical examples of methods to add, update, display data

---

## üõ† How to Use These Programs

1. Navigate to the folder.
2. Open any `.py` file to study the code and comments.
3. Run the scripts using:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. Modify the code to experiment with adding new features or improving functionality.
5. Use as a learning resource or base for your own OOP projects.

---

## üìö Recommended Next Steps

* Explore inheritance and polymorphism (OOP concepts extending classes and behaviors).
* Implement file I/O to save/load object data persistently.
* Add user interaction with menus and input validation.
* Expand these examples into full applications.
