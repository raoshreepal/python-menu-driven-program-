# NumPy Array Programs Collection

This repository contains **10 Python programs** demonstrating various NumPy array operations such as creating arrays, indexing, slicing, copying, reshaping, iterating, joining, splitting, searching, sorting, and filtering.

---

## Programs List

### 1. Create User-defined Array and Reshape

* Takes input from user for elements and shape
* Reshapes 1D input into 2D NumPy array

### 2. Array Indexing and Slicing

* Demonstrates accessing elements and slicing arrays using indices

### 3. Copy vs View in NumPy Arrays

* Shows difference between shallow copy (view) and deep copy

### 4. Array Shape and Reshape

* Allows user to define shape and reshapes arrays accordingly

### 5. Iterating Over Arrays

* Uses loops to iterate through arrays and print elements

### 6. Joining and Splitting Arrays

* Demonstrates vertical and horizontal joining
* Splits arrays into sub-arrays

### 7. Searching Elements in Arrays

* Uses `np.where()` to find indices of user-input elements

### 8. Sorting Arrays

* Sorts arrays along specified axis (row-wise or column-wise)

### 9. Filtering Arrays

* Applies conditions to filter elements (e.g., values > some threshold)

### 10. Combining Multiple Operations

* Mixes indexing, reshaping, copying, and searching for practice

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x and NumPy installed.
2. Run any program file using:

```bash
python program_name.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter inputs.

## Example

**Program 1: Create User-defined Array and Reshape**

Input:

```
Enter total number of elements (must equal rows * columns): 6
Enter elements:
10
20
30
40
50
60
Enter rows: 2
Enter columns: 3
```

Output:

```
Reshaped 2D Array:
[[10 20 30]
 [40 50 60]]
```
