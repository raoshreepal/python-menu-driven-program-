# 19. Alarm Clock Program
# This script sets an alarm for a specified time in 24-hour format.
# It continuously checks the current time every 10 seconds and triggers the alarm when the set time is reached.
# The user inputs the alarm time in "HH:MM" format, and the program will print a message when the alarm goes off.
# Make sure to run this script in an environment where you can see the output, as it will wait until the alarm time is reached.
