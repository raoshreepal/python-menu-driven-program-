Here's a well-structured **`README.md`** file you can include with your Python programs for handling **2D, 3D, and 4D arrays using NumPy**. It describes the purpose, input format, usage, and features of each script.

# 🔢 NumPy Array Operations – 2D, 3D, and 4D User-Defined Programs

This repository contains interactive Python programs that allow users to define and manipulate **2D**, **3D**, and **4D NumPy arrays** using built-in NumPy functions.

Each program prompts the user to input array dimensions and data, then performs a variety of operations like slicing, indexing, reshaping, copying, sorting, filtering, and more.

---

## 📁 Programs Included

### ✅ 1. `practical_2d_array_operations.py`

**Description:**
- Allows user to create a 2D array with custom dimensions and values.
- Demonstrates operations such as:
  - Indexing & slicing
  - Shape & reshaping
  - Copy vs view
  - Iteration
  - Sorting
  - Filtering (values > 50)

**Sample Input:**
```bash
Enter number of rows: 2
Enter number of columns: 3
Enter 6 integers: 10 60 70 40 20 90
````

---

### ✅ 2. `practical_3d_array_operations.py`

**Description:**

* Creates a 3D array from user input and performs:

  * Shape printing
  * Indexing & slicing
  * Splitting and joining arrays
  * Searching for a value
  * Iteration over depth

**Sample Input:**

```bash
Enter depth: 2
Enter rows: 2
Enter columns: 2
Enter 8 integers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```

---

### ✅ 3. `practical_4d_array_operations.py`

**Description:**

* Lets user define a 4D array and demonstrates:

  * Slicing (first dataset/block)
  * Iteration over each dataset
  * Flattening to 1D
  * Filtering values greater than 100
  * Optional reshape to 2D for clean display

**Sample Input:**

```bash
Enter size for Dimension 1: 1
Enter size for Dimension 2: 2
Enter size for Dimension 3: 2
Enter size for Dimension 4: 2
Enter 8 integers: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
```

---

## 🧠 Features & NumPy Concepts Used

All programs demonstrate core NumPy functionalities:

* `np.array()` – Array creation
* `reshape()`, `shape`, `flatten()`
* `indexing`, `slicing`
* `copy()`, `view()`
* `sort()`, `where()`, `filtering`
* `concatenate()`, `array_split()`
* `iteration` over dimensions

---

## 🚫 Note

These programs currently support up to **4D arrays only**.

* **5D and higher dimensions are not included** to maintain performance and user clarity.

---

## ▶️ Run Instructions

Make sure you have Python and NumPy installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Then run any file:

```bash
python practical_2d_array_operations.py
python practical_3d_array_operations.py
python practical_4d_array_operations.py
```

## 📌 Author

Created for educational and demonstration purposes for learning **multidimensional NumPy arrays** through **real-time user input**.

Would you like me to generate the `.py` files as well or bundle all three into a **single menu-driven Python file**?
