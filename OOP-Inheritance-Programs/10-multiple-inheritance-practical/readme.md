# Practical Multiple Inheritance in Python

Welcome to the **10-multiple-inheritance-practical** folder!
This collection of Python programs explores **multiple inheritance**, where a class inherits from more than one parent class.

## üìå What is Multiple Inheritance?

Multiple inheritance allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from **two or more parent classes**.
This enables combining functionalities from different sources into a single class.

Example:

```
      Parent1     Parent2
          \         /
           \       /
           ChildClass
```

## üöÄ Concepts Highlighted

* **Multiple Inheritance:** One class inheriting from multiple parents.
* **Combining Functionalities:** Reusing code from different classes effectively.
* **Method Resolution Order (MRO):** Understanding how Python decides which parent method to call.
* **Complex Real-world Models:** Banking, e-commerce, HR, healthcare, hospitality, education, vehicle registration.
* **Avoiding Conflicts:** Proper use of super() and method overriding to handle ambiguity.

## üõ† How to Use

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Open any script file in an IDE or text editor.
3. Run the program to observe multiple inheritance in action.
4. Modify or extend the classes to experiment with combined behaviors.

## üìö Why Learn Multiple Inheritance?

* Enables flexible and powerful object-oriented designs.
* Facilitates code reuse across unrelated features.
* Helps model complex systems combining diverse traits.
* Understanding multiple inheritance and MRO is essential for advanced Python programming.

## üôå Suggestions for Further Study

* Experiment with super() calls in multiple inheritance scenarios.
* Study diamond problem and how Python resolves it using MRO.
* Combine with polymorphism and interfaces (abstract base classes).
* Build larger projects integrating multiple inheritance patterns.
