# Practical Hybrid Inheritance in Python

Welcome to the **10-Hybrid-inheritance** folder!
This collection contains Python programs that demonstrate **hybrid inheritance**‚Äîa combination of two or more types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical) within the same program.

## üìå What is Hybrid Inheritance?

Hybrid inheritance is a **mix of different inheritance types** in a single hierarchy.
It allows creating complex relationships between classes to model real-world systems more accurately.

Example:

* A class can inherit from a parent class in a multilevel chain.
* Another class might inherit from multiple parents (multiple inheritance).
* These forms combined together create hybrid inheritance.

## üöÄ Concepts Highlighted

* **Hybrid Inheritance:** Combining multiple inheritance types (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical) in one design.
* **Complex Class Relationships:** How different inheritance structures work together.
* **Method Resolution Order (MRO):** Handling method lookup order in complex inheritance.
* **Real-world Modeling:** Building more realistic and modular systems using hybrid inheritance.
* **Code Reusability and Organization:** Leveraging inheritance for clean, maintainable code.

---

## üõ† How to Use

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Open any script file with an IDE or text editor.
3. Run the program to see hybrid inheritance in action.
4. Experiment by modifying classes and inheritance relationships to deepen understanding.

## üìö Why Study Hybrid Inheritance?

* Most real-world applications have complex hierarchies needing hybrid inheritance.
* Understanding hybrid inheritance helps design scalable and maintainable OOP solutions.
* Prepares you for advanced software design and patterns.
* Helps avoid pitfalls like ambiguity and conflicting methods using MRO.

## üôå Suggestions for Further Exploration

* Explore **super()** in hybrid inheritance to manage parent class calls effectively.
* Study **diamond problem** cases and Python‚Äôs MRO solution.
* Combine hybrid inheritance with **polymorphism** and **encapsulation**.
* Build larger projects like school management, hospital systems, or banking apps using these concepts.
