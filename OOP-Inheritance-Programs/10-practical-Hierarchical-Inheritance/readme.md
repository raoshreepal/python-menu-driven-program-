# Practical Hierarchical Inheritance in Python

Welcome to the **10-practical-Hierarchical-Inheritance** folder!
This collection of Python programs demonstrates **hierarchical inheritance**, where multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.

## üìå What is Hierarchical Inheritance?

Hierarchical inheritance occurs when one parent class serves as a base for multiple child classes.
Each child class inherits attributes and methods from the parent but can also have its own specialized behaviors.

Example:

```
          Parent
          /    |    \
      Child1 Child2 Child3
```

## üìÇ Programs Included

### 1. **Bank-System-Person-Customer-Employee.py**

Simulates a banking system with Person as the base class and Customer & Employee as children.

### 2. **E-Commerce-User-Seller-Buyer.py**

Models an e-commerce platform: User is the parent of Seller and Buyer classes.

### 3. **Hierarchical-Inheritance-with-5-Child-Classes.py**

Demonstrates hierarchical inheritance with five distinct child classes from one parent.

### 4. **Hospital-System-Person-Doctor-Nurse.py**

Represents hospital staff hierarchy: Person as base, Doctor and Nurse as subclasses.

### 5. **Hotel-System-Person-Guest-Staff.py**

Models a hotel system with Person as parent, Guest and Staff as children.

### 6. **Library-System-Item-Book-Magazine.py**

Illustrates library items: Item as parent, Book and Magazine as child classes.

### 7. **Logistics-Transport-Truck-Train.py**

Shows transport modes: Transport as parent class, Truck and Train as children.

### 8. **Online-Learning-User-Student-Instructor.py**

Represents an online learning platform: User as parent, Student and Instructor as subclasses.

### 9. **School-Staff-Admin-Teacher.py**

Models school staff roles: Staff as parent, Admin and Teacher as children.

### 10. **University-Person-Student-Teacher.py**

Represents university roles: Person as base, Student and Teacher as subclasses.

### 11. **Vehicle-System-Vehicle-Car-Bike.py**

Models vehicles: Vehicle as parent, Car and Bike as children classes.

## üöÄ Concepts Highlighted

* **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple child classes inherit from one common parent.
* **Code Reusability:** Common features implemented in the parent class, specialized in children.
* **Method Overriding:** Child classes customize parent methods as needed.
* **Real-world Domain Models:** Banking, e-commerce, healthcare, hospitality, education, logistics, and transport.
* **Clean Organization:** Clear class hierarchies modeling practical scenarios.

## üõ† How to Use

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your machine.
2. Open any program file with your favorite editor or IDE.
3. Run the script to see hierarchical inheritance in action.
4. Modify the classes to experiment with inheritance behavior and method overrides.

## üìö Why Learn Hierarchical Inheritance?

* Efficiently models systems with shared base traits but different specialized roles.
* Simplifies code by avoiding duplication of common features.
* Enhances flexibility by allowing varied child behaviors while maintaining base consistency.
* Important foundation for advanced OOP concepts and design patterns.

---

## üôå Suggestions for Further Learning

* Combine hierarchical inheritance with other inheritance types (multiple, multilevel).
* Explore polymorphism in hierarchical setups.
* Add input validation and exception handling for robustness.
* Extend the examples into full applications with databases or GUIs.
