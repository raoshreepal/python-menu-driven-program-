# Single Inheritance Practical Programs

Welcome to the **Single Inheritance Practical** folder!
This folder contains Python programs showcasing different types of **inheritance** concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with clear, practical examples.

## 📌 What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass). It promotes:

* Code reusability
* Logical class hierarchy
* Easier maintenance and extension of code

## 📂 Programs in This Folder

### 1. **E-Commerce-Order-with-Dictionary-Inheritance.py**

Demonstrates inheritance by managing e-commerce orders stored as dictionaries, showing how child classes extend or override parent class functionality.

### 2. **Inventory-Tracker-with-Dict-Inheritance.py**

Tracks inventory items using dictionary data structures while utilizing inheritance to manage item categories.

### 3. **Library-System-using-ictionary.py**

Implements a library system where books and users are handled via dictionary-based inheritance.

### 4. **Shape-Area-Calculation-using-Inheritance.py**

Shows geometric shape classes inheriting from a base class to calculate areas for different shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle).

### 5. **Simple-Banking-App-using-List.py**

Models a banking application using list structures, demonstrating account inheritance for various account types.

### 6. **Single-Inheritance–Employee-Salary-Details.py**

A simple example focusing on employee salary details and inheritance of employee attributes.

### 7. **Student-Ranking-with-NumPy-Array-Manual.py**

Combines inheritance with NumPy arrays to rank students based on scores.

### 8. **Student-Subject-List-and-Tuple.py**

Uses inheritance to manage student subjects stored in lists and tuples, illustrating data handling techniques.

### 9. **Vehicle-Inheritance -Tuples-Logic.py**

Demonstrates vehicle-related classes inheriting from a base vehicle class, using tuples to store properties.

### 10. **employee-Payroll-using-Tuple.py**

Illustrates payroll processing using tuples and inheritance for different employee roles.

### 11. **student-result.py**

Manages student results using inheritance to differentiate between student types or grading schemes.

## 🚀 Key Inheritance Concepts Covered

* **Single Inheritance:** One child inherits from one parent class.
* **Method Overriding:** Child classes override parent methods to provide specific behavior.
* **Using built-in data structures (dict, list, tuple) with inheritance:** Combining OOP with data handling.
* **Real-world use cases:** E-commerce, banking, education, and inventory management.
* **Integration with NumPy:** Handling numerical data alongside inheritance.

## 🛠 How to Use These Programs

1. Ensure you have Python installed (and NumPy for relevant files).
2. Open any program in your IDE or text editor.
3. Run the program to observe inheritance behavior and outputs.
4. Modify or extend classes to deepen your understanding.

## 📚 Why Learn Inheritance?

* Avoid code duplication by reusing existing code.
* Model real-world relationships between entities naturally.
* Enhance code organization and readability.
* Facilitate easier debugging and future code expansion.

---

## 🙌 Suggestions to Extend

* Add multiple inheritance examples.
* Implement polymorphism with these classes.
* Add user input or file I/O for dynamic data management.
* Integrate with databases or web APIs.
